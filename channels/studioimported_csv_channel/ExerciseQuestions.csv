Our land is blessed with many rich mineral resources ‚Äì gold, diamond, bauxite, manganese and oil. Mining, therefore, contributes immensely to the national income. Communities from where these resources are derived should not be adversely affected by their extraction. Unfortunately, that appears to be the lot of many mining communities in the country which now face poverty, deprivation and squalor as a result of the extraction processes. 

The typical scene that confronts any visitor to a mining community is the sharp contrast between the beauty that adorns the settlements of the mining executives and the squalor of the communities in which those mineral resources are located. The many years of neglect of the communities by the mining companies has brought about environmental degradation and health hazards for the people. The concerns of the mining communities were recently articulated by the President of the country when he received a delegation from a mining company. He said that he appreciated what they had done so far and appealed to them to do more to enhance the development of the local communities. There is no doubt that mining companies have built clinics and schools, made some donations and provided electricity. As of now, the mining sector has employed some people and contributes to 30% of the national export revenue. That notwithstanding, considering the wealth generated from the extraction of mineral resources, it is quite clear that the mining companies have relegated the welfare of the people to the periphery of their activities. 

A recent study has indicated that most of the people affected by mining operations are not satisfied with their compensation packages. Compensation should cover not only the payment of cash but also land allocation for farming activities and financial aid. The message to the mining companies is simple: they should do more than they have done so far. They should initiate programmes which can minimize the environmental hazards caused by their activities and ensure that the people benefit from their operations. 

A piece of welcome news would be the establishment of a mining fund devoted to the development of the mining communities. In addition, the mining laws should be critically re-examined. Those that deal with the payment of compensation for land, crops and buildings should protect the interest of the people. For instance, the percentage of mineral revenue paid as royalty should be adjusted upwards. 

While attention is being focused on the broad legal framework guiding mining operations, the government should take steps to see that these recommendations are implemented. There should be joint efforts between the players in the mining sector and government to find lasting solutions to the plight of the mining communities.</div>
